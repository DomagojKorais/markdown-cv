## Work experience

`Oct 2018-now`

Junior software developer at <a href="https://www.cybertec.it/en/">Cybertec</a>, Trieste (Italy).

### What am I doing:
- Developing mainly server side the company's APS (advanced planning and scheduling) Web application, using Typescript, Node.Js, SQL, Backbone.js, some C++.
- Implementing new functions based on customer necessities.
- Using Selenium Web Driver for automated browser-based testing.
- During the master thesis we developed a rule-based system in order to make the company product more competitive.
The main idea is to translate domain knowledge into rules, expressed using linguistic variables, and than fine-tune the mapping between linguistic variables and quantitative values using machine learning.
